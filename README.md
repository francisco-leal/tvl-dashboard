# Talent Protocol

> Talent Protocol is the web3 professional community where high-potential builders can transform loose connections into a support network able to invest in their future.

Our mission is to help the **next generation of builders** achieve success and fulfilment by enabling **collective careers**.

Until now careers have mostly been a single-player game where only a privileged few can win. With web3, careers are becoming multiplayer journeys where early support is rewarded and success is shared.
